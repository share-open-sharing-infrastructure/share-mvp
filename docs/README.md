# Overview

This is the work-in-progress home of documentation for the [share platform](https://github.com/share-open-sharing-infrastructure/share-mvp/tree/documentation). We are still in the process of setting everything up for contributors. If you wish to contribute, [contact us via mail](mailto:allerleih@posteo.org).

For diagramming, we use [Mermaid.js](https://mermaid.js.org/). Everything else is held as plain and simple as possible:

- [domain-model.md](domain-model.md) contains higher-level diagrams useful for conceptual understanding and work.
- [data-model.md](data-model.md) contains the ER diagram that maps directly onto the database structure.
- [best-practices.md](best-practices.md) documents architecture or code patterns we rely on and would ask contributors to consider when implementing.
- [testing-strategy.md](testing-strategy.md) contains the current status of and explanations for testing.
- Actual TypeScript types as used in the source code live in "src/lib/types/models.ts".
