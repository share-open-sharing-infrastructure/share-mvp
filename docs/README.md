# Overview

This is the work-in-progress home of documentation for the [share platform](https://github.com/share-open-sharing-infrastructure/share-mvp/tree/documentation). We are still in the process of setting everything up for contributors. If you wish to contribute, contact [Matteo via mail](mailto:matteo.ramin@outlook.com).

For diagramming, we use [Mermaid.js](https://mermaid.js.org/). Everything else is held as plain and simple as possible:

- [domain-model.md](domain-model.md) contains higher-level diagrams useful for conceptual understanding and work.
- [data-model.md](data-model.md) contains the ER diagram that maps directly onto the database structure.
- Actual TypeScript types as used in the source code live in "src/lib/types/models.ts".
